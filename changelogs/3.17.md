**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.200**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.17.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.200.
- Removed compatibility with earlier versions.

## Known issues (please don't open issues for these)
- Walls don't connect to each other
- Pumpkin and melon stems may not connect to their corresponding pumpkin/melon
- New blocks, items & mobs aren't implemented
- Nether doesn't exist

# 3.17.1
- Fixed some instances of plugin-caused crashes not being detected (eval()'d code, custom plugin paths).
- Server uptime is now included in crash reports.
- Hoes now take damage when used to break sponges.
- Using lava as fuel in a furnace now leaves behind an empty bucket.

# 3.17.2
- Fixed region header corruption when chunks with larger-than-expected lengths are found. These chunks are now treated as corrupted, instead of automatically attempting to salvage them (which usually fails anyway).
- `RegionLoader->removeChunk()` now allows the space used by the removed chunk to be reused by future region saves.
- Extracted `Living->applyConsumptionResults()` from `Living->consumeObject()` (preparation for a future bug fix).
